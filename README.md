üìå Requirement Analysis: Detailed Explanation
Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software product.

üß© What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of:

Identifying what users need from a software system.

Understanding and documenting those needs clearly and precisely.

Ensuring the feasibility and consistency of requirements with the business objectives and technical constraints.

It acts as a bridge between the client‚Äôs vision and the developer‚Äôs implementation, ensuring the end product fulfills the actual need.

üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Elicitation

Collecting requirements from stakeholders using methods such as interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, brainstorming, or prototyping.

Requirement Analysis and Negotiation

Organizing, prioritizing, and resolving conflicts among different stakeholder needs.

Verifying technical feasibility.

Requirement Specification

Converting requirements into a clear, structured document (Software Requirements Specification - SRS).

Requirement Validation

Checking for completeness, correctness, consistency, and ensuring that all stakeholder needs are accurately represented.
